Question: What is blue-green Deployment? How is it useful?

Answer: Blue-green deployment is a methodology for releasing software in a controlled and low-risk manner. It involves creating two environments, referred to as blue and green. The blue environment is the live production environment, serving all client traffic, while the green environment is an identical clone used to test and validate the new version of the application.

Once the new software version is ready and fully tested on the green environment, the traffic is switched (or gradually moved in case of canary testing) from the blue environment to the green environment. With this method, if there's a need to rollback, it's as simple as switching back the traffic to the previous version.

This strategy is useful because it minimizes downtime during application deployment. The application remains available to users throughout the entire process. It also offers a failsafeâ€”should something go wrong, rollback is easy and instantaneous by re-routing the traffic back to the blue environment (previous version).

Diagram/Example:


In this diagram, initially, all requests are routed to the blue environment. When a new software version is ready, it is deployed to the green environment. After it passes all tests, the router starts routing the requests to the green environment. If the new version fails in production for some reason, the router goes back to routing requests to the blue environment.  ```mermaid graph LR
