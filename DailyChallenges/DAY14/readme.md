Day 14 Challenge: Orchestrating Yelb with Docker Compose

Hello Learners,

Welcome back to the DevOps SRE Daily Challenge! 🎉



Over the past few days, we’ve explored Docker fundamentals, Dockerfiles, networking, and volumes. Today, we’ll take it further by introducing Docker Compose, a tool for easily defining and managing multi-container applications.

By the end of this challenge, you’ll understand how to orchestrate the Yelb application using a docker-compose.yml file, enabling simplified deployment and management of services.



What is Docker Compose?
Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container applications. With a single YAML file, you can specify all the required services, networks, and volumes, streamlining deployment and configuration.



Why Use Docker Compose?
Simplicity: Replace long Docker commands with a clean YAML configuration.
Multi-Container Management: Start, stop, and scale all services with a single command.
Portability: Share the Compose file for consistent deployments across environments.

Challenge Steps
Install Docker Compose

Ensure Docker Compose is installed on your system.
Verify installation:
docker compose version
Write a docker-compose.yml File
Create a docker-compose.yml file to define all Yelb services:
Redis: Cache layer.
PostgreSQL: Persistent data storage.
Appserver: Application logic.
UI: User interface.
Refer to Yelb project docker-compose file.
Deploy the Application

Start all services with a single command:
docker compose up -d
Verify the Deployment

Check the status of all containers:
docker compose ps
Open your browser and visit http://localhost:8080 to interact with the Yelb UI.
Stop and Clean Up

Bring down all services and remove containers, networks, and volumes:
docker compose down --volumes

Submission Guidelines
Proof of Completion:

The screenshot of docker compose ps showing all running containers.
Screenshot of the Yelb UI in the browser.
Your docker-compose.yml file.
Documentation:

Describe how Docker Compose simplifies deployment.
Highlight the challenges you faced and how you resolved them.
Share Your Progress:
Post your experience on social media with the hashtags: #getfitwithsagar, #SRELife, #DevOpsForAll

Bonus Tasks
Scale the appserver service to run multiple instances:

docker compose up --scale appserver=3
Verify load balancing using logs or requests.

Customize service health checks in the Compose file.

Share the docker-compose.yml file on GitHub with a README.


Why This Matters
Learning Docker Compose is a significant step toward managing containerized applications efficiently. It prepares you for handling real-world multi-container orchestration, configuration, and scaling scenarios.
